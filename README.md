# Country Guessing Game on Polkadot Parachain

## Short Summary

An educational game where players guess countries based on flags, built on the Polkadot parachain to leverage decentralized and secure transactions.

## Full Summary

An engaging and competitive educational game where players guess countries based on their flags, built on the Polkadot parachain to leverage decentralized, secure, and transparent transactions. Our program incentivizes education by adding a DeFi incentive built on the Polkadot parachain. We are working on creating the future of edtech.

## Problem Statement

Education can sometimes be perceived as dull or uninspiring, particularly in subjects like geography. Traditional methods often fail to engage students effectively. There is a need for innovative ways to make learning more interactive, enjoyable, and rewarding.

## Educational Impact

Tools like the Country Guessing Game have significant potential to transform educational settings by making learning more engaging and interactive. Here are some key educational benefits:

	1.	Increased Engagement: Gamification introduces an element of fun into the learning process. When students find learning enjoyable, they are more likely to engage deeply with the material.
	2.	Motivation through Competition: Healthy competition can motivate students to perform better. Competing against peers encourages students to put in more effort and achieve higher scores, thereby improving their knowledge and skills.
	3.	Improved Retention: Interactive learning experiences, such as guessing games, can improve retention of knowledge. The act of recalling information in a game setting helps reinforce learning and aids in long-term memory retention.
	4.	Instant Feedback: The game provides immediate feedback on answers, allowing students to learn from their mistakes and understand the correct information instantly.
	5.	Skill Development: Beyond factual knowledge, the game helps develop critical thinking and quick decision-making skills. Players must think quickly and accurately under time constraints, enhancing their cognitive abilities.
	6.	Inclusive Learning: Gamified learning tools cater to diverse learning styles. Visual learners, in particular, benefit from the use of images (flags) in the game, while competitive learners are motivated by the game’s competitive aspect.

## Solution

The Country Guessing Game addresses these issues by gamifying the learning process. Players are shown a flag and must guess the corresponding country. The game alternates between two players, keeping track of their scores. At the end of the game, the player with the highest score wins and receives a specified amount of DOT from the losing player. This competitive element incentivizes learning and makes the process more engaging.

## How Polkadot Parachain Was Used

The Polkadot parachain provides a secure, decentralized, and transparent platform to handle the game’s transactions. By leveraging the Polkadot parachain, we ensure that all transactions between players are conducted securely and transparently, with no need for intermediaries. This integration not only enhances security but also builds trust among players, knowing that their rewards and wagers are managed in a decentralized manner.

## Technical Description

## SDKs and Tools Used

	•	Polkadot.js: Utilized for interacting with the Polkadot blockchain to fetch account balances and handle transactions.
	•	React.js: Frontend framework for building the interactive UI.
	•	Canva: Used for creating the presentation slides.

## Features of Polkadot and Polkadot Parachain

	•	Decentralization: Ensures that the game operates on a trustless network, eliminating the need for intermediaries.
	•	Security: Utilizes Polkadot’s robust security model to protect in-game transactions.
	•	Interoperability: Polkadot’s parachain functionality allows for seamless integration and interaction with other blockchain networks.
	•	Scalability: Polkadot’s architecture supports high transaction throughput, ensuring smooth gameplay even with a large number of users.
	•	Custom Smart Contracts: Custom smart contracts were developed to handle the game logic and transactions between players.
	•	NFT Integration: Implemented proper NFT-minting integration to enhance the game’s functionality and player rewards.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
